        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Welcome to my page, my name is Kirsten Stevens and this is my second
            semester in the program here at USF. I studied Spanish and French at Uw-Madison
            (Go Badgers) and was a student athlete.</p>
        <p> After teaching for 3 years, I decided to go back to school to learn how to make 
            educational programs that fit the interests and needs of the learner. When I'm not
            doing school work or coaching, I'm usually improving my cooking and baking skills or 
            playing video games with friends. I'm highly interested in learning how to design
            game-based educational programs.</p>
