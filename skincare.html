    <button class="accordion">Oily</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>To reduce breakouts from oily skin, look for products that contain 'non-comedogenic' ingredients which means they won't clog your pores. Common comedogenics include olive oil, argan oil, coconut oil, and soybean oil</p>
    <p>Choose a sunscreen that isn't oil based, look for products that have gel or water-based formulas and have a matte finish. Sunscreen contains high penetration filters to block out UVA and UVB rays. Although this protection is important, it can also irritate the skin and lead to breakouts. Some brands of sunscreen offer lower penetratition filters that are lighter on the skin while still offering protection.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Dry</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Hydration is key for protecting and nourishing dry skin. On the back label of the sunscreen bottle, look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and glycerin as they help lock in moisture.</p>
    <p>If you can't find sunscreen with those ingredients, any ordinary sunscreen will do as long as you apply a regular moisturizer to your skin first. </p>
    </div>


    <button class="accordion">Sensitive</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Avoid sunscreens that are full of fragrances, preservatives, or alcohol as these irritate the skin. Be careful, the majority of sunscreens include the chemical Para-Aminobenzoic Acid (PABA) which protects from harsh UVB rays. Studies have shown that this chemical can cause allergic reactions and in extreme cases, damage human DNA. </p>
    <p> Select sunscreens that are mineral-based with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. These minerals are especially helpful to those that suffer from eczema or rosacea.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Dark Complexion</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Don't use mineral-based sunscreen as they tend to leave the skin looking gray and ashy. Try to use a non-comedogenic spray or tinted lotion for sun protection.</p>
    <p>Although darker skin complexions naturally produce SPF (up to 13), it's advised to still apply sunscreen as the development of melanoma is possible.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Fair Complexion</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>For someone with fair skin, it's recommended to use a minimum SPF of 50 and try to limit your time out in the sun. Although sprayable sunscreen is just as effective as a lotion or stick, it's difficult to see if it's been applied to the body evenly. To reduce chances of uneven sunburns, a lotion is best.</p>
    <p>If you have fair skin and burn easily, don't over exfoliate! Exfoliation removes the top layer of your skin which increases your chances of burning. If you have recently exfoliated, you may need to use a stronger SPF or reapply your sunscreen more frequently.</p>
